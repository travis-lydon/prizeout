# Giftcard Booking

We are going to sell giftcards on a minimalistic website.

The users identify using their email address (ignore passwords on this task), they select their currency & can then browse the available giftcards.

They can click a giftcard to see its details, and purchase a quantity of up to 5 giftcards at a time.

We need to keep track of our users' purchases & balances.

We list the available brands & we purchase the giftcards from a mock-api located at `https://us-east1-prizeout-non-prod.cloudfunctions.net/mock-api/`.

We have built the basics of the website & the API to get you started.

User accounts are generated with a random balance, and stored in the `mock_partner_users` table in the database.

## Tasks

- Load & display the giftcards
- Create a giftcard details directive. Show that directive when a user clicks a giftcard on the giftcard list.
- Create a giftcard booking process. The user should be allowed to buy up to 5 giftcards at a time.
- Create a record of the purchases.
- Keep track of the user's balances.
- Secure the ajax requests between the client-side & the API (Example: signing, encryption, ...)
- Add comments on the scalability of your code wherever you deem fit.
